Hello everyone,

Welcome to Miss M's DevOps Kitchen

I hope everyone likes to Cook?

Because you might

  Be already using Containers

    And Orchestration

      In your everyday Cooking.

Like have you ever used canned food?

  Or put leftovers into a container

   That you eat later.

We could also think

 Of the cooked - Or orchestrated

  Meal as an app ..

That you could create

  But not just for yourself

    But maybe for the whole world to enjoy.

 This requires a form of a repetable recipe

  That works in all kinds of situations

    So that anyone can make it

      Without having to teach

        Everyone separately how to do it.

Be it either in the end

  Consumed by yourself alone

    Or a remote village of strangers with pitchforks

      .. that particularly like garlic.

When we make our components of the meal re-usable

  We could then more easily create a whole book of recipes

    When we didn't have to repeat ourselves too much.

Like when I make my spaghetti bolognese

  a.k.a. spagbol

    I need tomatoes, onions, garlic, mince, spaghetti

      And lots of chilli because that's *MY* spagbol.

All of these ingredients provider something to the meal

  And thats what I call functionality.

Some either like chili or don't - do you? 

So for this reason

  You might want some flexibility in your recipes too.

Just like in a computer application - or the app -

  It's been typically divided into elements

    Based on what each element provides

      Just like all of the ingredients in food do.

Now I don't think anyone

  Expects food to just magically make itself?

Like - when you bring those groceries home

  You don't just throw them onto the floor

    And wait for a tree perhaps to grow off that mess?

I mean.

The dog might have eaten it long before then.

This is why we use recipes

  To communicate for both ourselves and others on

    How we put it all together
 
      And to make it again and again 

       With more consistent repeatable results.

Like the tomatoes -

  Is a component - or an element - on my spagbol

    That provides the acidity and so on to the meal.

We also tend to make our recipes situational.

After a busy day while being hangry.

  I just wnat to make it fast.

And for this reason,

I typically buy the canned tomatoes

  Without any trade-offs on taste,

    added sodium among other things

      That the canned stuff often can have.

You can also buy those canned tomatoes in various forms

  Either whole, crushed, pureed, diced and so on.

I just buy the crushed kind

  Because I just like it all crushed!

I simply take it all out from their canned container

  And stuff it straight into my dutch oven

    To wait for the other elements join the fun.

Thats what a container essentially is.

  It's the contained definition of a shopping list of ingredients

    And what's done to those ingredients.

Before all of it - stuffed - or contained - in a can.

Just like what a can of tomatoes is

  And what's done to it

    crushed, diced, pureed and so on 

      Designed to contribute that acidic base taste of the meal.

That can of tomatoes.

Is just another container we already perhaps use.

That I can swap around my recipe easily

  Be it crushed, diced or pureed -

    Or use them all in combination.

They all provide similar function

  But in diffeerent forms.

But someone had to create that container

  Or that can of tomatoes. 

A lot of things happened

  To get to the final contained product

    Of a can of tomatoes.

They had to grow the right kind of tomatoes,

 harvest them at the right time,

  process, quality control,

   measure the pH for preservation
 
    .. and so on 

     .. before stuffing that all 

      Into that can of tomatoes.

Container definition includes all that

  So it's repeatable, easily maintained

    And consumed as a predictable consistent unit

Otherwise.

  We might end up with inconsistency.

Like if we can our tomatoes ourselves

  We might end up harvesting the unripe tomatoes

Neither you would want

  Everything mixed into a single container - or a can

    Unless you prefer that overly processed

     pasta sauce kind of thing

With inferior taste and lots of preservatives like sodium

  That is neither versatile for many recipes.

And since you now have this awesome

  Contained definition

   - or a benchmark -

    For .. " What Do Great Tomatoes " Look like?

You can now also re-use it

  In your other recipes!

I could even just spin up

  Some awesome canned tomatoes

    And eat them as-is!

      Bon App√©tit!

But to put the whole meal together

  We need to orchestrate it together.

With all the other contained elements

 Including our previously canned tomatoes.

Now for me to orchestrate

 My whole meal

   From those contained elements.

First I need to figure who I am feeding to?

 Is it just for myself

  Or perhaps for a date too?

   Or.. perhaps a family of three

    If my date earlier perhaps

     Really liked my spicy spagbol?

       Now that's some Mon amour!

But then what about all that equipment - or infrastructure

Like the size of the pans and pots

  To ensure I am caramelizing and not steaming my onions.

My cloud provider might be the gas stove or induction kind

  Or a hybrid combination of those

    Depending on our tastes .. and wallets.

Then finally when orchestrating it for myself

 I might subconsciously start by browning some onions.

  Add some mince into the searing mix.

   Boil some spaghetti

    And throw that all in random order

     Into my dutch oven to bubble a bit.

But to share these recipes among each other us

 And make them consistently repeatable

  For both ourselves and others.

   Our recipes need to be flexible enough

    To scale up to that hangry village of people

     Waving their pitchforks.

For this reason.

Your recipe might say per person

 200 grams of tomatoes

  Or for a unicorn like me

   600 grams of tomatoes.

And to define how big of a pan or pot you use

 To steam, sear or caramelize

  For each element

   Or contained component of the meal.

In these great flexible recipes

 We divide the recipe into contained units

  To make our overall orchestrated meals.

That are repeatable in many settings and scales

  With pitchforks involved - or not.

Best thing orchestrating with chili containers is that.

You can just destroy some of them away from the spagbol

 If your date didn't like all that chili you threw in

And if they do like it hot

 You could just orchestrate more of chili containers.

Or if they keep changing their mind

 You can just orchestrate couple first

  And then destroy few

    And then put them all back!

Without it all going cold

 And having to remake the whole meal!

Now how hot and cool is that? 

Just too bad that

  It doesn't take that garlic breath away

    Consumed from the yesterday.

And has anyone tested

  Spaghetti pineapple bolognese yet?

You could just orchestrate your bolognese

  With a pineapple container and test it out!

Yum!

You could also

  Bring a virtual machine

    Of a pineapple to it.

But it's never the same!

As the spagbol will be cold

  When the pineapple VM finally arrives.

You see

 With containers

  You can run many brains

   Within a brain.

And with virtual machines

 You need to run many heads

  For all those brains.

Whilst it would be nice

  To have many heads.

I would prefer

  To just have more brains

    Without the overheads.

So again.

a container

  Is both the ingredients

    And what was done within

      To fit the overall recipe.

And orchestration

 Makes those contained elements

  Work with each other

   Facilitated by given infrastructure

    For the benefit of the consumers

     Of the overall product.       

p.s. I love pineapple in my spagbol.

.... Do you?
